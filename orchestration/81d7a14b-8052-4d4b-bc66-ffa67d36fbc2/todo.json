  "user_prompt": "Comprehensive code review of the repository at the working directory. Goals: (1) identify correctness issues, edge cases, and risky patterns; (2) propose small, mechanical refactors to improve clarity and safety; (3) call out missing linters/formatters or inconsistent style; (4) provide unified diffs for the top 3 highest-impact changes; (5) produce a prioritized refactor checklist with effort/impact estimates. Constraints: do not access network or install dependencies; work with files on disk only; keep suggestions minimal and aligned with existing style. Output: concise summary, specific file/line references, diffs where feasible, and next actions.",
