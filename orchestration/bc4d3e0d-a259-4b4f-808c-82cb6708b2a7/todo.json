  "user_prompt": "Comprehensive repository QA: Perform a full code review of the current repo at `/Users/leonardsellem/Documents/Manual Library/Dev/codex-subagents-mcp`. Goals: architecture/risk assessment, readability/maintainability, dependency health, and consistency (formatter/linter). Deliver: 1) Review summary, 2) Prioritized findings with severity (blocker/high/med/low), 3) Concrete suggestions as unified diffs with exact file paths, 4) Refactor checklist grouped by effort (S/M/L), 5) Risk notes and any migration guidance. Constraints: focus on small mechanical refactors first; no bikeshedding; assume restricted network; prefer local analysis of files. Output must follow your Shared Protocol and Output Contract.",
