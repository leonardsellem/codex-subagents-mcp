  "user_prompt": "DevOps review for this repo. Goals: (1) propose a simple GitHub Actions CI (build + lint + test on Node 18/20/22 across OS matrix); (2) add a lightweight release workflow to cut GitHub Releases on tags with changelog notes; (3) ensure least‑privilege with repo‑scoped tokens and no secrets required; (4) advise on caching and retention. Constraints: do not install deps; produce ready‑to‑drop YAML and concise steps. Output: actions YAMLs and short notes.",
