  "user_prompt": "Perform a lightweight security review of this MCP server repository. Goals: (1) outline trust boundaries and STRIDE‑style threat model; (2) scan for risky patterns (shell spawn, path traversal, untrusted input, secret leakage); (3) check tool surface for least‑privilege and safe defaults; (4) propose concrete mitigations with file/line references and small diffs; (5) recommend secret handling and CI hardening. Constraints: no network access; do not install tools; only read files. Output: concise risk table with severities, explicit mitigations, and a short checklist to adopt.",
