  "user_prompt": "Audit and improve the test strategy for this repository. Goals: (1) summarize current tests and gaps; (2) propose a minimal, high‑value test plan for critical paths (MCP framing, frontmatter parsing, delegate/delegate_batch schema, orchestrator routing); (3) provide Vitest test stubs or diffs to add; (4) outline a CI test matrix and how to run locally. Constraints: no network; do not install new deps; assume Vitest is available via package.json scripts. Output: concise plan with file‑scoped test diffs and commands.",
