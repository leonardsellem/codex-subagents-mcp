  "user_prompt": "Performance QA for this TypeScript MCP server. Goals: (1) identify obvious hotspots in I/O, JSON framing/parsing, and child process spawn; (2) suggest minimal, measurable optimizations with before/after metrics to capture (e.g., framing throughput, CPU while parsing, spawn latency); (3) outline a light benchmarking plan using node scripts or Vitest benches. Constraints: no network; no installs. Output: short list of hotspots with code pointers and concrete fixes, plus a tiny benchmarking plan.",
